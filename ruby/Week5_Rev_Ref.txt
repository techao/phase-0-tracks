1.	Data structures are useful in programming for accessing large amounts of data that can be grouped together. 

2.	An array a collection of objects, that can be seen represented as a vriable with multple vlaues. The collection objects are indexed, meaning the first value within the brakcets, '[]' is index 0 and so on. The index values can be redfined, and the array can have multple identical objects. Objects in an aray are mutable 
Obejects are accessed or called with corresponding index. 

3.	Example of appropirate arrays:

Name of students in a particular class:
student_names ["Mikey", "Rachel", "Tony", "Tony S.", "Tiffany", "Ashley", "etc" ]

Menu Items of a particular category:
entrees ["Scallop_Riso", "Lamb_Shank", "Gueinea_Hen_Confit"]



4. Define "hash" and describe the characteristics of a hash.
uses key to acces item. 
Access values and data by accesing keys or symbols. 

5. Give two original examples of data sets that a hash might be well-suited for.
The menu of a chinese restaurant where the menu is divided into sub categories and within in each section there might be gluten gree options or spicy dishes. 


6. Why is iteration useful?
Allows for the ability to go through arrays or hashes and checking each item, element, key, value, etc for certain conditions. Lets coder run a program/ block of code  with each item in a collection of items. 



7. Give an example of a real-life task that would require iteration if you wrote an algorithm for it.
Looking for a specfic name in a very large guestlist. 


8. What is a block?
 A method within another method that grabs the data from the enclosing method.


9. What is a block parameter, and where does its value come from?
It is the variable that is being taken in by the method that is being called. The value of the variable is dependent on the method the block is associated with.
