# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
It's a tool that let's you keep track of the progress you've made in your code. It's helpful because you can edit, revert and create backups in your code. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is an identical copy of the project you want to work on. You would want to branch your project as to not make errors that would otherwise break your master code. It's a safer and more convinient for group projects and overall just a good habit to get into for those reasons.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a way to make save points in git. A good commit message in git should be specific explanation of what was done in that commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is an error that usually occurs when the branch that you're working on and the branch that you want to merge into your current branch get separated. They happen when the changes you make in your branches disagree with each other, hence the term, "you've conflicted your files".
