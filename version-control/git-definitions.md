* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is the tracking of changes made in files containing information or data, which in this case of coding seems to be mainly plain text. 
It's useful because it helps manage the implementation of changes, such as  additional information, data, text, code, etc, into what could be a large and  very complicated project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a duplication of an initial file that allows modifications to be implemented and occur parallel with that initial fial without actually affecting that very original file. 
This method is useful in collaborative projects or any large project that is broken in up into several parts. The different parts can be developed co-dependently without having a final affect on the overall project until those parts are individually approved, through whatever neceesary means.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a change made to a file. A good commit message would a meaningful one that explains or plainly states the change that occur along with the commit. 
* What is a merge conflict?
When files can't merge because the changes or formatted version of the files do not agree. Example, merge conflict from merging a .txt file where a particular line is deleted from one of the versions while that exact same line has only been altered in the other. The line can't exist and not exist as it was deleted in on and altered in another. A merge conflcit would thus occur.
